        Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        In today's fast-moving world and tough competitive day-to-day life, the youth hardly find time for remembrance of our rich heritage and past. This becomes most crucial whilst the nation celebrates Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav (commemoration of 75 years of Indian Independence). The fight against colonial rule in India constitutes a unique narrative, one which is not marred by violence. Rather a narrative that is full of variegated stories of valor, bravery, Satyagraha, dedication, and sacrifice across the length and breadth of the subcontinent. These stories compose the rich Indian cultural heritage and traditions. Thus, the unsung heroes need not necessarily define the lesser-known freedom fighters. They may, at times, be the leaders whose ideals delineate the Indian value system.

The Section on Unsung Heroes is an attempt to recall and remember forgotten heroes of our freedom struggle, many of whom might be renowned yet unknown to the new generation. The aim of recreating and bringing forth stories, which lay as faded memories of the past, shall serve as a medium of inspiration and encouragement for the coming generations. India 2.0 is not just about fuelling the spirit of India in any one particular paradigm of growth. It encompasses all spheres of life, most of all by enriching our hearts and souls. The spirit of India is incomplete whilst we take our unsung heroes along this journey of growth and development. Their ethos and principles ought to be recalled and respected
